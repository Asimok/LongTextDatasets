In the style of the original Law & Order , episodes are often `` ripped from the headlines \'\' or loosely based on real crimes that have received media attention . Created by Dick Wolf , the series premiered on NBC on September 20 , 1999 , as the second series in Wolf \'s successful Law & Order franchise . Law & Order : Special Victims Unit has been nominated for and won numerous awards , including the 2006 Emmy for Outstanding Lead Actress in a Drama Series for Mariska Hargitay , the first , and to date only , Emmy to be received by a regular on any Law & Order series . It is the current longest running scripted non-animated U.S. primetime TV series since the cancellation of the original Law & Order on May 24 , 2010 and is the fourth - longest running scripted U.S. primetime TV series on a major broadcast network . </P> <P> Law & Order : Special Victims Unit originally centered almost exclusively on the detectives of the Special Victims Unit in a fictional version of the 16th Precinct of the New York City Police Department . As the series progressed , additional supporting characters were added as allies of the detectives in the New York County Manhattan District Attorney \'s office ( known as advisers from the Sex Crimes Bureau ) and the Medical Examiner \'s office . Certain episodes will go into detail about detectives \' personal lives and how they may or may not tie into the crimes dealt with during the show . Typical episodes follow the detectives and their colleagues as they investigate and prosecute sexually based offenses , child abuse , and crimes against the elderly . The show starred Christopher Meloni as Detective Elliot Stabler and Mariska Hargitay as Detective Olivia Benson for its first twelve seasons until the former left the cast , unable to come to an agreement on his contract . </P> <P> On May 12 , 2017 , the series was renewed for a nineteenth season , which premiered on September 27 , 2017 . As of January 17 , 2018 , Law & Order : Special Victims Unit has aired 421 original episodes . </P> <P> </P> <H2> Contents </H2> ( hide ) <Ul> <Li> 1 Production <Ul> <Li> 1.1 History and development <Ul> <Li> 1.1. 1 Executive producers </Li> </Ul> </Li> <Li> 1.2 Filming </Li> <Li> 1.3 Broadcast history </Li> <Li> 1.4 Russian adaptation </Li> </Ul> </Li> <Li> 2 Casting <Ul> <Li> 2.1 Salaries </Li> </Ul> </Li> <Li> 3 Cast and characters </Li> <Li> 4 Series overview </Li> <Li> 5 Episodes </Li> <Li> 6 Reception <Ul> <Li> 6.1 U.S. television ratings </Li> <Li> 6.2 Awards and honors </Li> </Ul> </Li> <Li> 7 Broadcast and streaming <Ul> <Li> 7.1 Syndication </Li> </Ul> </Li> <Li> 8 International broadcast </Li> <Li> 9 References <Ul> <Li> 9.1 Notes </Li> <Li> 9.2 Bibliography </Li> </Ul> </Li> <Li> 10 External links </Li> </Ul> <P> </P> <H2> Production ( edit ) </H2> <H3> History and development ( edit ) </H3> <P> The idea for Law & Order : Special . Victims Unit originated with the 1986 `` preppie murder \'\' case of Robert Chambers , who strangled Jennifer Levin , a woman he dated whom he later killed during what he claimed was consensual `` rough sex \'\' in Manhattan \'s Central Park . The crime inspired Dick Wolf to write the story for the season one episode of Law & Order titled `` Kiss the Girls and Make Them Die \'\' . Even after writing the episode , however , the case continued to haunt Wolf , who wanted to go deeper into the psychology of crimes to examine the role of human sexuality . </P> <P> The original title of the show was Sex Crimes , reflecting the sexual nature of the crimes depicted on the show . Initially there was concern among the producers that , should Sex Crimes fail , identifying the new show with the Law & Order franchise could hurt the original show . Additionally , Ted Kotcheff wanted to create a new series that was not dependent upon the original series for success . Wolf felt , however , that it was important and commercially desirable to have `` Law & Order \'\' in the title , and he initially proposed the title of the show be Law & Order : Sex Crimes . Barry Diller , then head of Studios USA , was concerned about the title , however , and it was changed to Law & Order : Special Victims Unit to reflect the actual unit of the New York City Police Department ( NYPD ) that handles sexually based offenses that are especially heinous . The first episode , `` Payback \'\' , premiered on NBC on September 20 , 1999 . </P> Executive producers ( edit ) <P> Executive producer Neal Baer left Law & Order : SVU as showrunner at the end of season twelve , after eleven years ( seasons 2 -- 12 ) on the show , in order to sign a three - year deal with CBS Studios . Baer was replaced by former Law & Order : Criminal Intent showrunner Warren Leight . In March 2015 , it was announced that Warren Leight signed a three - year deal with Sony Pictures Television , that will allow him to work on SVU one more season , its seventeenth . Leight joined the show in season thirteen . It was announced on March 10 , 2016 that original Law & Order veteran producer Rick Eid would take Leight \'s place as showrunner starting in season 18 . Creator Dick Wolf commented to The Hollywood Reporter , `` I \'m extremely pleased that Rick had decided to rejoin the family and hope that he will be here for years to come . \'\' During post-production of season 18 , following the announcement that SVU was renewed for a nineteenth season , it was revealed that Rick Eid departed the series . He will be taking over another Dick Wolf / NBC series . Chicago P.D. </P> <P> It was announced on May 25 , 2017 that original Law & Order and Law & Order : Criminal Intent showrunner Michael S. Chernuchin would be reprising his role starting on season nineteen . Chernuchin was also co-creator and executive producing showrunner of Chicago Justice , another Wolf - related show that was canceled by NBC at the end of the 2016 -- 17 TV season . </P> <H3> Filming ( edit ) </H3> SVU shooting on location in Central Park at night <P> Many exterior scenes of Law & Order : Special Victims Unit are filmed on location in New York City , Wolf \'s hometown , throughout all five of New York City \'s boroughs . As the NYPD encounters varied law enforcement challenges on a daily basis , the backdrop provides the writers a supply of ideal locations from which to choose . Fort Lee , New Jersey served as the filming location for Detective Elliot Stabler \'s residence in Queens , New York . </P> <P> When searching for a place to film the interiors of the show , the producers found that there were no suitable studio spaces available in New York City . As a result , a space was chosen at NBC \'s Central Archives building in nearby North Bergen , New Jersey , which had sat empty for some time , and featured air - conditioning , adequate parking , and 53,000 square feet ( 4,900 m ) of stage area . The Archives building was used for police station and courtroom scenes , with various other locations in Hudson County used for other scenes , such as a scene shot at the Meadowlands Parkway in Secaucus in 2010 . The production left New Jersey for New York in 2010 , however , when New Jersey Governor Chris Christie suspended the tax credits for film and television production for the Fiscal Year 2011 to close budget gaps . The show moved into the studio space at Chelsea Piers that had been occupied by the original Law & Order series until its cancellation in May 2010 . </P> <H3> Broadcast history ( edit ) </H3> <P> The show originally aired on Monday nights at 9 : 00 p.m. ET for the first nine episodes , from September 20 through November 29 , 1999 . It was then shifted to Friday nights at 10 p.m. ET on January 7 , 2000 , and remained in that time slot through the end of season four on May 16 , 2003 . Beginning with the season five premiere on September 23 , 2003 , SVU moved to Tuesday nights at 10 : 00 p.m. ET . NBC airs repeats on Saturday nights at varying times and previous episodes are shown on the USA Network on varying days in marathon blocks </P> <P> With the season eleven premiere on September 23 , 2009 , the series vacated its Tuesday 10 p.m. ET slot because NBC began a prime - time weeknight Jay Leno series . The new time slot became Wednesday nights at 9 : 00 p.m. ET on NBC , with CTV still airing SVU on Tuesdays at 10 : 00 in Canada . After the 2010 Winter Olympics on March 3 , 2010 , the time slot for SVU changed again to Wednesdays at 10 p.m. ET , where it stayed until the twelfth season . In the 12th season , SVU moved back to 9 : 00 p.m. to lead in the newest Law & Order spinoff , Law & Order : LA , until it was pulled from the network in January 2011 to be retooled . SVU moved back to 10 : 00 p.m. on January 12 , 2011 , until the end of the 13th season . With season 14 , SVU moved back to 9 : 00 p.m. after a two - hour season premiere event on September 26 , 2012 , a position the show has held since . </P> <H3> Russian adaptation ( edit ) </H3> <P> In 2007 , the Russian production company Studio 2B purchased the rights to create an adaptation of Law & Order : Special Victims Unit for Russian television . Titled –ó–∞–∫–æ–Ω –∏ –ø–æ—Ä—è–¥–æ–∫ : –æ—Ç–¥–µ–ª –æ–ø–µ—Ä–∞—Ç–∏–≤–Ω—ã—Ö —Ä–∞—Å—Å–ª–µ–¥–æ–≤–∞–Ω–∏–π ( Law & Order : Division of Field Investigation ) , the series stars Alisa Bogart as Major Olga Bobrova . The series follows a unit of investigators in Moscow whose job is to investigate crimes of a sexual nature . The series airs on NTV and is produced by Pavel Korchagin , Felix Kleiman , and Edward Verzbovski and directed by Dmitry Brusnikin . The screenplays are written by Sergei Kuznvetsov , Elena Karavaeshnikova , and Maya Shapovalova . </P> <H2> Casting ( edit ) </H2> Cast of Law & Order : Special Victims Unit Cast of seasons 4 -- 5 ( 2002 -- 04 ) , from left : Ice - T , Richard Belzer , Mariska Hargitay , Dann Florek , Christopher Meloni , B.D.

Dick Wolf , along with officials from NBC and Studios USA were at the final auditions for the two leads at Rockefeller Center . The last round had been narrowed down to seven finalists . For the female lead , Detective Olivia Benson , actresses Samantha Mathis , Reiko Aylesworth , and Mariska Hargitay were being considered . For the male role , Detective Elliot Stabler , the finalists were Tim Matheson , John Slattery , Nick Chinlund , and Christopher Meloni . Hargitay and Meloni had auditioned in the final round together and , after the actors left , there was a moment of dead silence , after which Wolf blurted out , `` Oh well . There \'s no doubt who we should choose -- Hargitay and Meloni . \'\' Wolf believed the duo had the perfect chemistry together from the first time he saw them together , and they ended up being his first choice . Garth Ancier , then head of NBC Entertainment , agreed , and the rest of the panel assembled began voicing their assent . </P> <P> The first actor to be cast for the show was Dann Florek . Florek had originated the character of Captain Don Cragen in the 1988 pilot for Law & Order and played the character for the first three seasons of the show until he was fired on the orders of network executives , who wanted to add female characters to the all male primary cast . He maintained a friendly relationship with Wolf , however , and went on to direct three episodes of the original series as well as to occasionally guest star on the show . Shortly after Florek reprised his role for Exiled : A Law & Order Movie , he received a call to be on Sex Crimes . Initially reluctant , he eventually agreed to star on the show as Cragen on the assurance that he would not be asked to audition for the role . </P> <P> Shortly after the cancellation of Homicide : Life on the Street , Richard Belzer heard that Benjamin Bratt had left Law & Order . Belzer requested his manager to call Wolf and pitch the idea for Belzer \'s character from Homicide , Detective John Munch , to become the new partner of Jerry Orbach \'s character , Detective Lennie Briscoe , since they had previously teamed in three Homicide crossovers . Wolf loved the idea , but had already cast Jesse L. Martin as Briscoe \'s new partner , Detective Ed Green . The idea was reconfigured , however , to have Munch on Law & Order : Special Victims Unit instead . Since the character of Munch was inspired by David Simon \'s depiction of Detective Sergeant Jay Landsman and developed for Homicide by Tom Fontana and Barry Levinson , the addition of Munch to the cast required the consent of all three . The appropriate agreements were reached and , while Fontana and Levinson agreed to waive their royalty rights , contracts with Simon required that he be paid royalties for any new show in which Munch is a main character ; as a result , Simon receives royalties every time Munch appears in an episode of the show . </P> <P> Dean Winters was cast as Munch \'s partner , Brian Cassidy , at the insistence of Belzer . Belzer looked at Winters as a sort of little brother , and told Wolf , `` Well , I \'ll do this new show of yours , SVU , only if you make Dean Winters my partner . \'\' Wolf did make Winters Belzer \'s partner , but he was contractually obligated to his other show at the time , the HBO drama Oz . Since the role on Law & Order : Special Victims Unit was only initially meant to be a few episodes , Winters was forced to leave when it was time to film Oz again . Winters returned for the Season 13 finale , `` Rhodium Nights , \'\' reprising his role as Cassidy . He also appeared ( as Cassidy ) on the two - part Season 14 premiere `` Lost Reputation \'\' / `` Above Suspicion \'\' . He subsequently became a recurring character into season 15 . The void left by Winters \'s departure was filled for the remainder of the season by Michelle Hurd as Detective Monique Jeffries , a character who Wolf promised that , despite starting out as a minor character with one scene in the pilot , would eventually develop . Hurd left the show at the beginning of season two to join the cast of Leap Years . Munch \'s permanent partner came in the form of rapper - turned - actor Ice - T , who had previously worked with Wolf on New York Undercover and Exiled . Ice - T originally agreed to do only four episodes of Law & Order : Special Victims Unit , but he quickly gained affection for the ensemble nature of the cast . He relocated to New York City before his four - episode contract was up and remained with the show as Munch \'s permanent partner , Detective Odafin `` Fin \'\' Tutuola . </P> <P> Initially , the show focused exclusively on the policework of the detectives in the Special Victims Unit of the 16th precinct , with members of the District Attorney \'s office occasionally appearing as guest roles crossing over from the original Law & Order . From season two onwards , the format was changed to be more faithful to the original Law & Order concept by including court cases . Stephanie March had little television experience before being cast on Law & Order : Special Victims Unit , nor did she watch much TV . Nevertheless , March was cast as Assistant District Attorney Alexandra Cabot at the beginning of season two but still believed that , due to the grim nature of the series , it would be short - lived . She stayed with the series for three seasons , however , and left when she believed she had reached the natural conclusion of the character \'s development . She would later reprise the character as a guest appearance in season six and as a regular character on the short - lived Wolf series , Conviction , where she was promised more to do . Diane Neal had previously guest starred on Law & Order : Special Victims Unit in season three before being cast as Cabot \'s replacement , Casey Novak , in season five . Neal remained with the show through the end of season nine , after which she was replaced by Michaela McManus . March returned to the show in the tenth season ( after McManus \' departure from the cast ) when Neal Baer proposed Cabot receive a character arc to revitalize the second part of the season , which would continue through season eleven . </P> <P> Tamara Tunie was cast as medical examiner Melinda Warner in season two after working with Wolf previously on New York Undercover , Feds , and Law & Order . Warner was initially a recurring character but became a regular character in season seven , and Tunie was added to the opening credits at that time . When initially cast as Warner , Tunie was appearing as attorney Jessica Griffin on the CBS daytime soap opera As the World Turns . From 2000 to 2007 ( and again briefly in 2009 ) , she appeared on both series simultaneously . In 2002 , she also appeared on the Fox espionage - themed drama series 24 , in the recurring role of CTU Acting Director Alberta Green . B.D. Wong was asked to film four episodes as Dr. George Huang , a Federal Bureau of Investigation ( FBI ) forensic psychiatrist and criminal profiler on loan to the Special Victims Unit . After his four episodes , he was asked to stay on with the show . </P> <P> After he starred in Bury My Heart at Wounded Knee and guest starred as Detective Chester Lake in the eighth season , Wolf felt that Adam Beach would be a good addition to the cast and asked him to be a permanent member beginning with the ninth season . Although Beach felt the role was a `` dream role \'\' , the character proved unpopular with fans who felt that he was designed to gradually write out either Richard Belzer or Ice - T. Feeling there were too many police characters on the show , Beach left the show after only one season . Michaela McManus was originally felt to be too young for the role of an Assistant District Attorney ( ADA ) before being cast as ADA Kim Greylek in the tenth season . McManus , months removed from a recurring role on One Tree Hill , remained with the series only half a season , however , before departing for unspecified reasons . </P> <P> Paula Patton joined the cast as ADA Mikka Von . She replaced Stephanie March . However , Patton dropped out after one episode to film Mission : Impossible -- Ghost Protocol , and was replaced by Melissa Sagemiller in the recurring role of ADA Gillian Hardwicke . </P> <P> Before the end of season twelve , Mariska Hargitay asked for a lighter workload . As a way of writing her out of certain episodes , a plan to have her character promoted to a supervisory role was discussed . At the end of season twelve , Christopher Meloni departed the cast , unable to come to terms with his contract . Warren Leight became the new showrunner during this same year and signed on before he knew that Meloni would be leaving the cast . The second major departure to be announced in 2011 was that of B. D. Wong . On July 17 , Wong announced on Twitter that , `` I actually do not return for season 13 , I am jumping to Awake ! It \'s awesome ! \'\' Wong added , `` I do n\'t know if or when I \'ll be back on SVU ! It was amazing to have such a cool job for 11 years and to be a real NY Actor . \'\' Wong reprised his role as Dr. Huang in season 13 \'s episode `` Father Dearest \'\' . In response to these departures , two new main actors were hired , and several changes were made to the recurring cast . </P> <P> In June 2011 , it was announced that Kelli Giddish and Danny Pino would join the cast as new series regulars . Weeks later , it was announced that Stephanie March and Diane Neal would be reprising their roles as ADA Alexandra Cabot and ADA Casey Novak , respectively . The launch of season 13 was marked with a retooling of the show that Warren Leight referred to as `` SVU 2.0 \'\' . Changes that accompanied this included Tamara Tunie \'s being bumped from the main cast to a guest starring role and recurring actor Joel de la Fuente \'s not appearing for the first time since 2002 . Of the latter change , Warren Leight said , `` those scenes ( which featured Fuente ) can be dry \'\' and hired Gilbert Gottfried as a more comedic replacement . In addition to these changes , Linus Roache became a recurring cast member in his role of Michael Cutter , whom he played on Law & Order ; on SVU former Executive ADA Cutter serves as the Bureau Chief for ADAs attached to the Special Victims Unit . </P> <P> In season 14 , Ra√∫l Esparza joined the cast in a recurring capacity as ADA Rafael Barba and prior to the season 15 premiere , Esparza was promoted to a series regular . Also in season 15 , Belzer departed the cast in the fifth episode , `` Wonderland Story \'\' , in which Sgt . Munch retired from the NYPD and took a job in the DA \'s office as an investigator . Later in the season , Captain Cragen announced his departure from the NYPD , which made newly promoted Sgt . Benson the temporary squad commander . In leaving the cast , Florek ended a 400 - episode run as Captain Cragen . In season 16 , Peter Scanavino joined the series , first in a recurring role for episodes 1 -- 3 and then was promoted to the main cast in episode 5 , with Kelli Giddish , Danny Pino , Ice - T and Ra√∫l Esparza no longer appearing in every episode . On May 20 , 2015 , it was revealed that Danny Pino would be leaving the cast after the season 16 finale `` Surrendering Noah \'\' . </P> <P> In August 2017 , it was announced that Philip Winchester will recur in season 19 as ADA Peter Stone , his character from Chicago P.D. and Chicago Justice , who is the son of Benjamin Stone , the ADA on the original Law & Order show .

In New York City , the dedicated detectives who investigate these vicious felonies are members of an elite squad known as the Special Victims Unit . These are their stories . -- Opening narration spoken by Steven Zirnkilton <P> Based out of the New York City Police Department \'s 16th precinct in Manhattan , Law & Order : Special Victims Unit delves into the dark side of the New York underworld as the detectives of a new elite force , the Special Victims Unit ( SVU for short ) , investigate and prosecute various sexually - oriented crimes including rape , pedophilia , and domestic violence . They also investigate the abuses of children , the disabled and elderly victims of non-sexual crimes who require specialist handling . All the while trying to balance the effects of the investigation on their own lives . Its stories also touch on the political and societal issues associated with gender identity , sexual preferences , and equality rights . While the victim is often murdered , this is not always the case , and victims frequently play prominent roles in episodes . The unit also works with the Manhattan District Attorney \'s office as they prosecute cases and seek justice for SVU \'s victims and survivors with precision and a passion to win and bring closure to the intense investigations . The series often uses stories that are `` ripped from the headlines \'\' or based on real crimes . Such episodes take a real crime and fictionalize it by changing some details . </P> <P> Originally the show focused around the detective pairings of Elliot Stabler & Olivia Benson and John Munch & Brian Cassidy . Stabler is a seasoned veteran of the unit who has seen it all and tries his best to protect his family from the horrors he sees every day . His partner Benson \'s difficult past as the child of a rape victim is the reason she joined the unit . Backing them up is John Munch , and his first partner Brian Cassidy . Munch is a transfer from Baltimore \'s homicide unit , who brings his acerbic wit , conspiracy theories , and street - honed investigative skills . Whilst Cassidy is young and eager to learn from his fellow detectives . These two detective teams received support from Detectives Monique Jeffries and Ken Briscoe . When Cassidy transferred to Narcotics after thirteen episodes , Jeffries was partnered with Munch for the remaining of Season One and Briscoe was phased out . In the beginning of season two , Munch was then permanently partnered with Detective Odafin `` Fin \'\' Tutuola , whose unique yet sometimes vulgar sense of humor and investigative experience make him a formidable match for Munch . These detectives were supervised by veteran Captain Donald Cragen who oversaw the team from seasons 1 -- 15 . Cragen \'s tough - but - supportive approach to the team \'s complex cases guides the squad through the challenges they face every day . Also on the team \'s payroll is FBI Special Agent Dr. George Huang and Medical Examiner Dr. Melinda Warner . As the resident psychiatrist for the Special Victims Unit , Huang helps keep the officers sane in a field that could drive ordinary people mad . He has also served as the squad \'s resident criminal profiler , and his insights into the criminal mind have often helped the officers to crack the toughest perps , whilst Warner has become an integral part of the Manhattan Special Victims Unit , and her personal skills have contributed to the unit \'s high success rate in closing cases . </P> <P> The Unit did not receive a full - time assistant district attorney until season two , when Alexandra Cabot was assigned to work with the detectives . After Cabot \'s departure in season five , she was replaced by Casey Novak , who remained as the ADA until the end of season nine . Kim Greylek became the permanent ADA in the season ten premiere , until Cabot made a return midway through that season when Greylek departed . Cabot remained the ADA through the second half of season eleven . After Cabot \'s departure , the ADA void was filled by Sonya Paxton ( Christine Lahti ) and Jo Marlowe ( Sharon Stone ) until the conclusion of season eleven . Gillian Hardwicke served as the SVU ADA during season twelve . In season thirteen , both Cabot and Novak returned as ADAs and since the beginning of season fourteen , ADA Rafael Barba has been SVU \'s prosecutor . </P> <P> In season 13 other big changes happened when Stabler left in the season twelve finale . Detectives Nick Amaro and Amanda Rollins joined the team filling the void left by Stabler . Amaro brings empathy to his cases while dealing with a stressful home life , whilst Rollins \' dogged persistence and instincts help her close cases , but her secrets could derail her career . In the current seasons the Manhattan SVU is now run by Lieutenant Olivia Benson . </P> <H2> Episodes ( edit ) </H2> Main article : List of Law & Order : Special Victims Unit episodes <P> Law & Order : Special Victims Unit has concluded its eighteenth season and has started its nineteenth season .

Beginning with the season five , the show aired on Tuesdays to compete with CBS \' Judging Amy and ABC \'s NYPD Blue .
